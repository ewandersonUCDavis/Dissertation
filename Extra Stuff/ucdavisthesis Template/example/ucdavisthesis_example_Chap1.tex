\chapter{Information on Preparation of a Dissertation or Thesis}
%
The text for this example dissertation is taken from the Graduate Studies web site\footnote{Please see \texttt{http://gradstudies.ucdavis.edu/students/filing.html} for the latest information.}. Please read through it carefully to make sure that your dissertation/thesis meets the university requirements.

For information and assistance in the preparation of your thesis or dissertation, please contact the Student Affairs Coordinator responsible for your program. You must make an appointment with the Student Affairs Coordinator in order to file your thesis or dissertation.

You are responsible for observing the filing dates and for preparing the thesis in the proper format. As part of the electronic filing process you will complete the PQIL Masters Thesis Agreement (Master's students) or the UMI Doctoral Dissertation Agreement (Ph.D. students) on which you indicate your willingness to have the University supply copies of your thesis to interested persons immediately, or the dissertation submitted to ProQuest.

You must have committee approval (title page signed off by committee) before submitting your thesis/dissertation electronically.

Filing your dissertation or thesis is the last step in the process leading to the awarding of your degree. The final copy of your thesis or dissertation, which is ultimately deposited in the University Library, becomes a permanent and official record.


\section{Specifications}
%
Consult the calendar for the dates to file your thesis or dissertation at Graduate Studies. The dates are also in the General Catalog. You are responsible for observing the filing dates and for preparing the thesis or dissertation in the proper form.

Your thesis/dissertation must be submitted via the ETD website as a single PDF file. No file compression, password protection, or digital signature are allowed.

\subsection{Style and Format}
%
You should be guided on matters of style by the chair and members of your thesis committee. Graduate Studies is not concerned with the form of the bibliography, appendix, footnotes, etc. as long as they are done in some acceptable, consistent and recognized manner approved by your committee.

There are many valuable references available to assist students in preparing and writing research papers and theses \cite{Gibaldi:80, Strunk:00, UoCPress:03}. Listed below are references that have been suggested by students and faculty\footnote{Be sure to search the internet for additional writing resources.}.
%
\begin{itemize}
\item MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers, Theses and Dissertations, by Joseph Gibaldi
    and Walter S. Achtert: The Modern Language Association of America, 4th ed., 1980.
\item The Elements of Style, by William Strunk, Jr., E.B. White and Roger Angell: Longman, 4th ed., 2000.
\item The Lively Art of Writing, by Lucile V. Payne, Mentor Books, reissue ed., 1983.
\item The Chicago Manual of Style, University of Chicago Press, 15th ed., 2003.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Title/Signature Page}
%
You will need to produce two different title/signature pages:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item A title/signature page which will include a signature line above each committee members typed name. The signature page is to be signed by all members of your committee when they have approved the thesis or dissertation. All committee members must sign the same page and only original signatures will be accepted.
      \item A title page with the typed names of your thesis/dissertation committee without signatures. This will be the first page of the electronic thesis/dissertation PDF file which you will submit via the ETD website.  This second format is required to prevent the publication of the signatures of your committee members.
    \end{itemize}
    
Make an appointment with your Student Affairs Officer in Graduate Studies to submit the signature page and required forms. To find your assigned Student Affairs Officer in Graduate Studies, go to the Graduate Programs page and click on your program, then click on ``People.''  You will find their name and contact information there.

\subsection{Margins}
%
Every page of the dissertation or thesis must have a one inch margin on all sides (top, bottom, left and right).  However, the page number may appear outside of these margins.

Please Note: These minimum specifications also apply to all figures, charts, graphs, illustrations and appendices.

\subsection{Spacing}
%
Double spacing should be used in typing the thesis, except in those places where conventional usage calls for single spacing -- for example, footnotes, indented quotations, tables, and the bibliography.

\subsection{Pagination}
%
The preliminary pages, including the title page are numbered with small Roman Numerals which are centered at the bottom of the page. Begin numbering the preliminaries in lower case Roman Numerals with the title page which is always ``i''.

The text and all other pages of the thesis or dissertation, including charts, figures, caption pages, maps, and appendices are all numbered consecutively starting with Arabic ``1''. These page numbers should also be centered at the bottom of the page. (In most cases, this will start with the Introduction or Chapter 1.) Do not start renumbering pages at any point in the body of your thesis or dissertation.

With the exception of the copyright page (which should not be numbered or counted in the numbering sequence), every page must be numbered consecutively and there must be no blank pages.

\subsection{Typeface}
%
Consistency is essential. The same font size and style must be used throughout. Use a font size between 10 and 13 points.

Any font style is acceptable, however you must make sure all your fonts are embedded fonts. See the instructions for embedded fonts on the ETD website.

\subsection{Paper}
%
Your thesis/dissertation must be submitted electronically; therefore, the Office of Graduate Studies does not require you to provide a printed copy of your manuscript. However, members of your committee and/or your graduate program may require that you provide them with a paper copy. Consult with your graduate program and thesis/dissertation committee regarding printed copy requirements.
