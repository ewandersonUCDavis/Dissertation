Ideally, SOWFA would be validated by comparing simulation results to experimental data. However, no suitable experimental results exist. The large size of modern turbine rotors makes it difficult and expensive to run wind tunnel tests. The full scale wind tunnel tests that have been performed, such as those performed at NASA Ames Research Center by M. M. Hand et al.,\cite{simms2001} have used smaller turbines with very different aerodynamic properties that modern utility scale turbines. In the future it may be possible to gather suitable experimental data from in situ utility scale turbines. The Sandia Wake Imaging System, currently under development at Sandia National Laboratories,\cite{herges2015,naughton2015,herges2015a} seeks to capture high resolution velocity measurements within the inflow and wake of turbines operating in the field. Eventually Sandia National Laboratories hopes to use this capability to validate high fidelity wind turbine models.\cite{ herges2015a}

Until suitable experimental data is available, the best option for SOWFA validation is to compare simulation results generated by SOWFA to simulation results generated using a very different but well established method.
