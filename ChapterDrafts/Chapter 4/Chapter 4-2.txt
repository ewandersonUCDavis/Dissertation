The power generated by a turbine is given by $P_{gen} = T_{gen}\Omega_{gen}\eta_{gen}$ where $T_{gen}$ is the generator torque, $\Omega_{gen}$ is the generator speed, and $\eta_{gen}$ is the efficiency of the generator. For a given wind speed, a turbine can be derated by reducing $\Omega_{gen}$ and/or $\eta_{gen}$ below the normal operating values. Derating a turbine typically causes a reduction in both the power generation and structural loads of the turbine. However, reducing structural loads and is not always a goal of turbine derating. Therefore, the load reduction capabilities of derating are not always thoroughly examined in literature. Several derating methods have been proposed in literature. In this section three of those derating methods are investigated to determine which method is best suited for our feed forward controller.

Method 1 is based on “derating strategy C” proposed by Deshpande and Peters in "Wind turbine controller design considerations for improved wind farm level curtailment tracking."\cite{deshpande2012} In this method the rated generator speed remains unchanged and the turbine is derated by reducing the rated generator torque. The torque-speed curve of the generator torque controller (Figure \ref{fig1-2}) is scaled to accomodate this change. Method 2 is based on the derating strategy proposed by Frost, Goebel, and Obrecht in "Integrating Structural Health Management with Contingency Control for Wind Turbines."\cite{frost2013} In this method the torque-speed curve of the torque controller remains unchanged. The turbine is derated by changing the point on the torque speed curve at which the turbine switches to a region 3 control strategy. Essentially this method derates the turbine by reducing both the rated generator torque and the rated generator speed. Method 3 is based on the derating method proposed by Petrovic and Bottasso in "Wind Turbine Envelope Riding."\cite{petrovic2015} In this method the rated generator torque remains unchanged while the turbine is derated by reducing the rated generator speed. To accomodate the reduction in the rated generator speed ,the torque-speed curve of the generator torque controller is scaled and a minimum pitch angle is imposed on the blade pitch controller. 

To evaluate the three derating methods, all three derating methods are simulated for a pair of test cases. In test case one the turbine has been derated by 30\% and is operating in steady 16 m/s when it experiences an extreme operating gust. In test case two the turbine has been derated by 30\% and is operating in steady 12 m/s wind when it experiences an extreme operating gust. In both test cases the extreme operating gust is defined according to IEC 61400-1 \cite{IEC2005} for a class 1 turbine in category A turbulence. Figures \ref{fig4-1} through \ref{fig4-4} illustrate how the derating strategies affect the power generation, tower base fore-aft bending moment, blade root bending moment, and rotor speed. As expected, derating the turbine by 30\% results in a 30\% reduction in power production for all three derating strategies. The deviations in power production caused by the extreme operating gust are slightly larger for derating method 3, but otherwise all three derating strategies have a very similar effect on power production. In Figure \ref{fig4-2} we see that all three derating strategies have a similar effect on tower base fore-aft bending moment before and after the extreme operating gust, with a 30\% derating corresponding to a ?????findThis???? \% reduction. However, the derating methods have differing effects on the peak tower base fore-aft bending moments induced by the extreme operating gust. Derating method 1 has a peak moment of 88.4 MNm, a 13.5\% reduction compared to a non derated turbine, while derating method 2 has a peak moment of 85.2 MNm, a 16.6\% reduction. Derating method 3 performs significantly better with a peak moment of 65.8 MNm, a 35.6\% reduction. Figure \ref{fig4-3} tells a similar story. All three derating methods have a similar effect on blade root moments when the turbine is in constant wind, but they have differing effects when the turbine is experiencing an extreme operating gust. Once again, derating method 3 out performs the other two methods with respect to reducing peak structural loads. Derating method 1 reduces the peak blade root moment by 17.5\%, method 2 reduces the  peak blade root moment by 17.0\%, and method 3 reduces the peak blade root moment by 29.5\%. Figure \ref{fig4-4} shows that the three derating strategies have very different effects on rotor speed. It is not surprising that the derating method based on reducing the rated torque (method 1) has the least effect on rotor speed, the derating method based on reducing the rated generator speed (method 3) has the greatest effect on rotor speed, and the derating method based on reducing both the rated speed and rated torque (method 2) falls somewhere in between. With derating method 1 the turbine sees a peak rotor speed of 14.18 RPM, only a 1.1\% reduction from the non-derated turbine. That peak rotor speed is 17.2% over the turbine's rated rotor speed of 21.1 RPM. With derating method 2 the turbine sees a peak rotor speed of 13.57 RPM, a 5.4% reduction, which corresponds to a peak overspeed of 12.1\%. With derating method 3 the turbine sees a peak rotor speed of 10.40 RPM, a 27.5\% reduction, which is not an overspeed.

Test case 2, where a turbine is derated by 30\% and is operating in steady 12 m/s wind when it experiences an extreme operating gust, shows similar trends to test case 1. Plots of the power generation, tower base fore-aft bending moment, blade root bending moment, and rotor speed for test case two are not shown here. However, the performance observed in both test cases has been quantified and summarized in Table \ref{table4-1}. The table shows that derating method 3 is significantly better than methods 1 and 2 at reducing both the structural loads and the rotor overspeeds caused by an extreme operating gust. Since derating method 3 does the best job of mitigating the negative effects of a large gust of wind it is best suited for our feed forward controller. All further simulations described in this chapter use derating method 3. A more detailed description of derating method 3 and how it is incorporated into the NREL 5MW controller can be found in Section \ref{section4-5}.
