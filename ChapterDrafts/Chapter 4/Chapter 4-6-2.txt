The Extreme Operating Gust test case provides insight into how selective derating can reduce loading and overspeeds. However, constant wind speeds like those before and after the EOG in the previous section, are rare in the real world. When a turbine experiences a large gust it is most likely part of a turbulent wind field. In this section we examine the effect of selective derating feed forward control on a two turbine system experiencing turbulent wind with a large gust. As discussed in Section \ref{section4-5}, the NREL 5-MW turbine is vulnerable to large gust induced overspeeds when operating in region 3 control, which occurs in wind speeds between 12 m/s and 25 m/s. As Section \ref{section4-3} illustrates, structural loading and overspeeds vary across that range of wind speeds. In an effort to capture these variations, turbulent wind speeds with 3 different mean wind speeds were simulated. Figures \ref{fig4-27} through \ref{fig4-31} illustrate the 16 m/s turbulent wind test case, while Tables \ref{table4-4} through \ref{table4-6} quantify and summarize performance metrics for all test cases. For the sake of space, the 12 m/s and 20 m/s turbulent wind test cases are not illustrated with figures. However, the behavior seen in the 12 m/s and 20 m/s test cases is similar to what is seen in the 16 m/s case.


Figure \ref{fig4-27} shows the wind speed for 200 seconds of the 16 m/s turbulent test case. As the figure shows, the turbines are subjected turbulent fluctuations in wind speed throughout the simulation with a large gust at 200 seconds. The turbulent fluctuations were generated by TurbSim and are statistically realistic, however these wind speeds are applied uniformly over the whole rotor. Due to the limitations of FAST and TurbSim it was not possible to simulate full field turbulence with a large gust, so the spatial variations in wind speed that would be observed across the rotor in a real turbulent wind field could not be captured in this simulation.

Figures \ref{4-28} through \ref{4-31} show how feed forward selective derating control affects the rotor speed, tower base fore-aft bending moment, blade root moment, and power generation of the downwind turbine for 16 m/s turbulent wind with a large gust. As in Section \ref{4-6-1} two methods were used to time the derating of the downwind turbine.

Figure \ref{4-28} shows that the upwind turbine experiences many small overspeeds throughout the simulation and experiences a large overspeed of 17.77\% due to the large gust. This large overspeed could potentially cause an emergency overspeed shutdown of the upwind turbine. Selective derating feed forward control reduces the maximum overspeed experienced by the downwind turbine to approximately 5\%, which is in the normal range of operation for this turbine. In Figure \ref{fig4-29} we see that both the upwind and downwind turbines experience large tower base fore-aft bending moments due to the large gust, but the loads experienced by the downwind turbine are smaller. The feed forward controller has reduced the maximum tower base fore-aft bending moment by approximately 11\%. As in the previous section, we see that this system would be robust to changes in the arrival time of the gust. 

Figure \ref{fig4-30} shows that derating the downwind turbine for the 16 m/s test case has resulted in a higher peak blade root moment (BRM). Though this result is initially surprising, it can be explained when the factors contributing to the peak load are examined more closely. We can see from Figure \ref{fig4-30} that BRM has a large cyclical component. These cyclic changes in BRM have a frequency of 12 RPM, which corresponds to the rotational speed of the rotor, and are caused primarily by gravitational loads on the turbine blade. Section \ref{section4-3} showed that derating reduces BRM, and we see from Figure \ref{fig4-30} that derating reduces BRM prior to the arrival of the gust. However, the effect of a large gust on BRM is determined by both how much BRM the gust causes as well as the timing of the gust and how the gust induced loads interacts with the cyclic gravitational loads. For the upwind turbine, without derating, the gust arrives at an opportune time. A downswing in the cyclic gravitational loading largely cancels out the gust induced BRM and the effect of the gust is almost unnoticeable. For the downwind turbine, the derating process has reduced the rotational speed of the rotor. As a result, the downwind turbine is at a different and less opportune point in it's rotation when the gust arrives. In real world applications the timing of a large gust would be random. Because derating reduces the BRM induced by the gust we would expect derating to reduce peak BRM more often than not. However, as this result illustrates, derating does not always result in reduced peak BRM loads.

Figure \ref{fig4-31} shows power generation. As expected, derating results in reduced power generation. Derating based on a convection speed estimate results in 10.7 kWhr of lost energy production. The more conservative strategy of derating without a convection speed estimate results in 24.9 kWhr of lost energy production. However, as stated before, these derating strategies are intended to avoid emergency overspeed shut downs. An emergency overspeed shutdown would likely result in a much larger loss of energy.

Tables \ref{table4-4} through \ref{table4-6} quantify and summarize performance metrics for all three test cases: 12 m/s, 16 m/s, and 20 m/s. In an attempt to capture the overall wear and tear on the tower base and blade root, Damage Equivalent Loads (DEL) are reported instead of peak loads. Though the DEL, overspeed, and energy genration values vary between the test cases, the trends are the same. Selective feed forward derating reduces maximum overspeeds from more than 15/%, which could cause an emergency overspeed shut down, to approximately 5/%. Tower root bending DELs are significantly reduced for all test cases. Blade root moment DELs are reduced in some test cases, but increased in others. Energy production is reduced by tens of kWhr, which is equivalent to a few dollars of production.
