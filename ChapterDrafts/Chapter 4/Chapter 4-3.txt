This section investigates the relationship between derating and the dynamic turbine response. In particular we are interested in determining how derating affects the structural loading and rotor overspeed a turbine experiences when subjected to a large gust. To study these relationships a series of simulations were run subjecting a derated NREL 5MW turbine to an extreme operating gust at a variety of mean wind speeds and a variety of derating factors. The series of simulations included mean wind speeds of 6 m/s, 8 m/s, 10 m/s, 12 m/s, 14 m/s, 16 m/s, 18 m/s, and 20 m/s, as well as derating factors of 0\%, 5\%, 10\%, 15\%, 20\%, 25\%, and 30\%. For all simulations the turbine is operating in uniform, constant wind when it experiences an extreme operating gust (as defined by IEC 61400-1 \cite{IEC2005} for a class 1 turbine in category A turbulence).

Figure \ref{fig4-5} shows the relationship between derating factor and average power production for several of the mean wind speeds simulated. As expected, there is a 1 to 1 relationship between the derating factor and the reduction in power generation. Each 1\% of derating corresponds to a 1\% decrease in power production. The other wind speeds simulated also showed this same relationship.

Figure \ref{fig4-6} shows the relationship between derating factor and the maximum tower base fore-aft bending moment for several of the mean wind speeds simulated. One thing we see in this figure is that the turbine experiences the largest tower bending moments in simulations where the mean wind speed is equal to the rated wind speed of 12 m/s. The maximum tower bending moment decreases slowly and steadily as the mean wind speed is increased above 12 m/s. The maximum tower bending moment also decreases steadily, but more precipitously, as the mean wind speed decreases below 12 m/s. We also notice that the relationship between derating factor and maximum tower bending moment appears nearly linear. ????talk about slopes????

Figure \ref{fig4-7} shows the relationship between derating factor and the maximum blade root bending moment. For low derating factors we see again that highest loads occur when the mean wind speed is equal to the rated wind speed of 12 m/s and the maximum loads gradually decrease as the mean wind speed either increases or decreases away from the rated wind speed. However, at higher derating factors all of the test cases at or above the rated wind speed (12 m/s - 20 m/s) seem to converge. When the turbine is derated 25\% or 30\% the 12 m/s and 14 m/s simulations actually cause slightly larger maximum blade root moments. Again the relationship between derating factor and maximum load reduction appears nearly linear. ????talk about slopes????

Figure \ref{fig4-8} shows the relationship between derating factor and the maximum rotor speed, while Figure \ref{fig4-9} shows the corresponding maximum rotor overspeed. We see in these figures that the simulations with higher mean wind speeds have higher maximum rotor speeds and therefore higher maximum rotor overspeeds. As with the previous plots in this section we see a nearly linear relationship between ????not totally sure what to say here?????
