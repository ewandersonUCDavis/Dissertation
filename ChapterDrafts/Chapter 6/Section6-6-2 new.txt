This section documents the results of the Offset Turbine test case. This test case was run twice, once without Feed Forward Derating Control enabled and once with Feed forward Derating Control. The following figures and text analyze the behavior of the upwind turbine (which was identical in both runs of the Offset Turbine test case), the behavior of the downwind turbine when Feed Forward Derating Control is not enabled, and the behavior of the downwind turbine when Feed Forward Derating Control is enabled.

Figure \ref{fig6-14} shows wind speed in the computational domain at several key moments when Feed Forward Derating Control is not enabled. Each image in Figure \ref{fig6-14} was generated by taking a horizontal cross section through the center of the computational domain then trimming the cross section to remove regions that were far from the turbines in the downwind or horizontal directions. White lines have been superimposed on the images to show the locations and approximate sizes of the turbine rotors. At t=300 s we see the turbines operating in a steady, uniform 12 m/s wind. The wakes of each turbine are clearly visible, and we see that the downwind turbine is not in the wake of the upwind turbine. At t = 400 s the Extreme Coherent Gust (ECG) enters the computational domain. We see at t = 420 s that the gust has begun to propagate through the domain from left to right. Note that the gust has higer wind speeds at it's center and lower wind speeds near it's edges (as discussed in Section \ref{section6-4}). At t = 480 s we see that the gust has recently reached the upwind turbine. At t = 540 s we see the gust arriving at the downwind turbine. In the t = 540 s image we can also see that there is no wake trailing the upwind turbine. This indicates that the upwind turbine has shut down. At t = 660 s we see that the gust has continued to propagate downstream and there is no wake trailing the downwind turbine, which indicates that it has also shut down. A similar set of images was generated for the Offset Turbine test case with Feed Forward Derating Control (but is not shown here). Those images look very similar, except at t = 600 s. In the t = 600 s image a wake is visible trailing the downwind turbine, which indicates that Feed Forward Derating Control prevents the downwind turbine from shutting down.

It's noteworthy that the gust traveled from the upwind turbine to the downwind turbine in approximately 70 seconds. This corresponds to a convection speed of approximately 18 m/s. For many of the simulations carried out in chapters \ref{Chapter3} and \ref{Chapter4} I assumed Taylor's frozen turbulence hypothesis was valid. I made that assumption because it allowed me to model a two turbine system using FAST, but I noted at the time that the assumption was not expected to be completely valid. If Taylor's frozen turbulence hypothesis was valid for this test case we would expect the gust to propagate downstream at the average domain wind speed of 12 m/s. However, the gust propagates at neither the average wind speed (12 m/s) nor the gust wind speed (~25 m/s), but somewhere in between. This reinforces the importance of using a feed forward control scheme that is tolerant of uncertainty about gust propagation speeds. As discussed in Section \ref{section4-5}, the feed forward selective derating control scheme evaluated in this chapter is highly tolerant of uncertainty in gust propagation speed. The fed forward controller is not required to take any action at the exact moment the gust reaches the downwind turbine. It simply has to derate the turbine some time before the gust arrives and return the turbine to full rated operation some time after the gust has passed.

Figures \ref{fig6-15} through \ref{fig6-19} show the rotor speed, power generation, blade pitch, blade root bending moment, and tower base fore-aft bending moment of the turbines. We see in figures \ref{fig6-15} and \ref{fig6-16} that the turbines have reached steady state operation by t = 300 s. The rotors are turning at a constant rate of 12.1 RPM and  producing 5,000 kW of power. The Extreme Coherent gust reaches the upwind turbine at approximately 450 s, causing both the rotor speed and power generation to increase. At t = 469.7 s the rotor speed exceeds the 15\% overspeed limit and an emergency overspeed shutdown is initiated. If Feed Forward Derating Control is enabled, a signal is sent to the downwind turbine instructing it to derate by 10.37\% beginning at t = 481.7 s and return to full rated operation at t = 627.2 s. The upwind rotor comes to a halt at t = 480.9 s and is stationary for the remaining 219.1 seconds of the simulation. In real world operation this turbine would remain stationary until an operator can verify that is safe to return the turbine to operation. This could potentially be much longer than 219.1 seconds. Between t = 481.7 s and t = 511.7 s the downwind turbine with Feed Forward Derate control smoothly reduces it's rotor speed and power generation, while the turbine without feed forward control continues to operate at a rotor speed of 12.1 RPM and power generation of 5,000 kW. The Extreme Coherent Gust reaches the downwind turbine at approximately 520 s, causing both the rotor speed and power generation to increase. The downwind turbine without feed forward control exceeds the 15\% overspeed limit at t = 539.2 s and an emergency overspeed shutdown is initiated. By t = 550.5 s the downwind turbine without feed forward control is shut down. The downwind turbine with Feed Forward Derating Control experiences a maximum overspeed of 6.9\%, which does not cause an emergency overspeed shutdown. Between t = 627.2 s and t = 657.2 s the turbine transitions back to full rated operation.

Figure \ref{fig6-17} shows the blade pitch of the turbines. Initially, when the turbines are operating in uniform 12 m/s wind, the turbines have a steady blade pitch of 4.8\degree. As the upwind turbine begins to experience increased wind speed it's blade pitch increases. This is an effort by the turbine pitch controller to maintain a constant rotational speed of 12.1 RPM. We see in Figure \ref{fig6-17} the upwind turbine has a blade pitch of 18.3\degree when the emergency shutdown procedure is initiated at t = 469.7 s. After the emergency shutdown is initiated blade pitch increases to 90\degree at a rate of 8\degree /s. The downwind turbine without feed forward control shows similar behavior, reaching a blade pitch of 20.3\degree before the emergency shutdown is initiated at t = 539.2 s. The downwind turbine with Feed Forward Derating Control increases blade pitch from 4.8\degree to 6.1\degree when the turbine is derated (starting at t = 481.7 s). The gust causes an increase and some oscillation in blade pitch, with the blade pitch eventually settling to approximately 25.5\degree. When the turbine is returned to full rated operation, starting at t = 627.2 s, blade pitch decreases to 23.1\degree.

Figures \ref{fig6-18} shows blade root bending moment (BRM). Initially, when the turbines are operating in uniform 12 m/s wind the blade root bending moment is very regular. The upwind and downwind turbines experience nearly identical cyclical loading. When the upwind turbine begin to experience higher wind speeds and blade pitch begins to increase, the BRM loading cycle maintains it's shape but begins to decrease in magnitude. This effect can be seen from t = 430 s to t = 465 s. Durring the emergency shutdown process the shape of the BRM loading cycle changes and larger fluctuations in BRM can be seen. When the rotor comes to a halt the BRM settles to a constant value. Note that BRM is not 0 MNm when the turbine rotor stops. This residual loading is due to gravitational loads. BRM would only be 0 MNm if this blade happened to stop pointing directly up or down. The downwind turbine without feed forward control shows similar behavior in response to the Extreme Coherent Gust (EOG) and subsequent shutdown. The BRM loading cycle maintains it's shape but begins to decrease in magnitude between t = 500 s and t = 535 s. The shape of the BRM loading cycle then becomes irregular and there are a few large fluctuations before BRM settles to a constant value. The downwind turbine with Feed Forward Derating Control experiences a 12\% decrease in mean BRM and a 9\% decrease in the magnitude of BRM fluctuations starting at t = 481.7 s. These changes are primarily due to the increase in blade pitch caused by derating. When the Extremem Coherent Gust arrives and blade pitch is increased further, the mean BRM decreases to approximately 3 MNm (~60\% below the initial mean BRM) and the cyclical fluctuations in BRM have increased to approximately 4 MNm (~140\% above the initial magnitude of fluctuations).

In Figure \ref{fig6-19} we see that the upwind turbine and the downwind turbine without feed forward control exhibit similar behavior. Tower base fore-aft bending moments is initially constant at approximately 48 MNm. The tower base bending moment is highly dependent on the aerodynamic loading, which is highly dependent on blade pitch. As wind speeds begin to increase and blade pitches begin to increase we see a smooth reduction in tower fore-aft bending moment. The emergency shutdown process introduces a lot more oscillation in the tower base fore-aft bending moment, including one very large loading cycle where loading goes from approximately 35 MNm to approximately -40 MNm. This large spike in negative loading moment corresponds to the tower swinging forward after the aerodynamic loading on the rotor is suddenly reduced to zero when the blades pitch to 90\degree. Eventually all of the high frequency oscillations in loading die out and the tower base fore-aft bending moement settles to 0 MNm. The downwind turbine with Feed Forward Derating Control also begins with a tower base fore-aft bending moment of 48 MNm, but experiences a reduction in loading when the turbine is derated (starting at t = 481.7 s). This is consistent with a reduction in aerodynamic loading on the turbine rotor due to increasing blade pitch. When the Extreme Coherent Gust arrives the downwind turbine sees a further reduction in the average tower base fore-aft bending moment. However, we see the introduction of a cyclic loading component that persists through the end of the simulation. If we zoom in on these high frequency oscillations we see that the loading has a very similar shape to the cyclic BRM loading seen in Figure \ref{fig6-23}, but has a frequency three times higher. Since the turbine rotor has three blades, this indicates that the higher magnitude BRM oscillations seen near the end of the simulation are causing the high frequency oscillations in tower loading.

Table \ref{Table6-2} summarizes several important performance metrics for the turbines. We see in the table that Feed Forward Derating Control improves turbine behaviour in all four performance metrics. The upwind turbine and the downwind turbine without feed forward control have very similar tower base fore-aft bending moment Damage Equivalent Loads (DEL). Feed Forward Derating Control reduces tower base fore-aft bending moment DEL by 44.2 MNm, which is a reduction of 59\%. This is likely because the downwind turbine with feed forward derating control does not experience the very large magnitude loading cycles observed durring emergency shutdown. The downwind turbine without feed forward control experiences approximately 20\% higher blade root bending moment (BRM) DEL than the upwind turbine. Part of this difference is because the downwind turbine operates for longer and experiences more BRM loading cycles before the gust arrives. A contributing factor may also be the differences in the loading patterns observed near shutdown in Figure \ref{fig6-18}. These differences in loading patterns are caused by the interaction of the loading induced by the Extremem Coherent Gust and the cyclic loading due to the rotation of the turbine rotor. Feed Forward Derating Control reduces DEL BRM by 15\% despite the turbine operating for a longer period of time and enduring a larger quantity of BRM loading cycles. The upwind turbine and the downwind turbine without feed forward control experience similar maximum overspeeds, while the downwind turbine with Feed Forward Derating Control has a significantly smaller maximim overspeed. Finally, we see that the downwind turbine without feed forward control produces 96.46 KWh more energy than the upwind turbine. This is simply because the extreme coherent gust arrives at the downwind turbine ~70 seconds after it arrives at the upwind turbine. This allows the downwind turbine without feed forward control to generate electricity for an additional 70 seconds before experiencing an emergency overspeed shutdown. Feed Forward Derating Control further increases energy generation by 201.27 KWh.

It is important to note that the difference in energy generation could be much larger in real world operation. These simulations end at t = 700 s, but beyond that time the downwind turbine with Feed Forward Derating Control would continue to generate 5 MW (or ~1.4 KWH per second). The downwind turbine without feed forward control would not generate any power until it was returned to service. That turbine may be shut down for much longer than the 149.5 seconds captured in these simulations.
