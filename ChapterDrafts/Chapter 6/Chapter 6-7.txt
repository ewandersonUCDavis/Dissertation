In previous chapters we assumed the downwind turbine would be slightly offset from the upwind turbine and would not be in that turbine's wake. This was done out of necessity because FAST is not capable of modelling turbine wake effects. However, SOWFA is well suited to model turbine wakes and how those wakes effect downwind turbines. Mathew Churchfield and others at NREL have published several articles that use SOWFA to study such effects \ref{some sowfa studies}. Furthermore, wake effects are common in real world wind farms. This section documents SOWFA simulations of the turbine in wake test case illustrated in figure \ref{fig6-1}. In this test case one turbine is 1260 m (or 20R, where R is the rotor radius) directly behind and in the wake of another turbine.

6.6.1 Simulation Setup

The simulation domain is 5040 m \times 2520 m \times \2520 m (or 80R \times 40R \times 40R). This domain extends 1260 m (20R) in front of the upwind rotor and 2520 m (40R) behind the downwind rotor, as well as 1260 m (20R) both horizontally and vertically from the centers of the rotors. The computational domain is initially composed of approximately 32 m \times 32 m \times 32 m cells, but portions of the domain go through a series of grid refinements to reduce the size of the cells near the turbine rotors. The refinement regions are a series of 4 concentric cylinders with centerlines laying on the rotational axis of the NREL 5-MW rotors and having the dimensions shown in Table \ref{table6-1}. These refinement regions have the same radial dimensions as refinement regions 1 through 4 used in Chapter \ref{chapter5} SOWFA simulations (Table \ref{table5-1}). However, the streamwise dimensions have been increased to accomodate a second turbine. In the streamwise direction refinement regions 1, 2, 3, and 4 begin 8.5R, 4.5R, 2.5R, and 1.5R (respectively) in front of the upwind turbine.

Table6-5 *********************************

Each simulation is 700 seconds long, but the first 300 seconds are disregarded. This is to ensure that both turbines and their wakes have reached steady state before we start collecting data. Initially the inlet of the computational domain has a uniform 12 m/s wind speed. At 400 seconds a coherent gust is introduced in the center of the computational domain inlet. 

The coherent gust used for the turbine in wake test case is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig6-26} and is described by equation \ref{eq6-4}, where r_g is the radial distance from the centerline of the turbine rotors. As discussed in Section \ref{section6-5}, the coherent gust contains both higher speed regions (up to 26.41 m/s) and lower speed regions (as low as 7.59 m/s) so the average wind speed across the computational domain inlet remains 12 m/s. For the regions directly upwind of the turbine rotors the average wind speed durring the extreme operating gust is 25 m/s, which is the upper limit of the NREL 5MW turbine operating range.

6.7.2 Performance Without Feed Forward Derating Control *********************

Figure \ref{fig6-27} shows wind speed in the computational domain at several key moments. Each image in Figure \ref{fig6-14} was generated by taking a horizontal cross section through the center of the computational domain then trimming the cross section to remove regions that were far from the turbines in the downwind or horizontal directions. White lines have been superimposed on the images to show the locations and approximate sizes of the turbine rotors. At t=300 s we see that the upwind turbine is operating in a steady, uniform 12 m/s wind. The downwind turbine is subject to a lower and less consistent wind speed because it is in the wake of the upwind turbine. At t = 400 s the Extreme Coherent Gust enters the computational domain. We see at t = 420 s that the gust has begun to propagate through the domain from left to right. At t = 480 s we see that the gust has recently reached the upwind turbine. At t = 540 s we see the gust arriving at the downwind turbine. In the t = 540 s image we can also see that there is no wake trailing the upwind turbine. This indicates that the upwind turbine has shut down. At t = 660 s we see that the gust has continued to propagate downstream and there is no wake trailing the downwind turbine, which indicates that it has also shut down.

 Figures \ref{fig6-28} through \ref{fig6-32} show the rotor speed, power generation, blade pitch, blade root bending moment, and tower base fore-aft bending moment of the turbines. 
In Figure \ref{fig6-28} we see that the upwind turbine is initially rotating at a constant rate of 12.1 RPM. This is expected for a turbine in 12 m/s wind because it is operating in region 3 control. The downwind turbine, which is in the wake of the upwind turbine,  has a lower rotational speed with some fluctuations. The lower rotational speed indicates that the downwind turbine is operating in region 2 control, which does not track a constant rotational speed. Region 2 control uses generator torque to vary rotational speed in an attempt to maximize power generation. The Extreme Coherent gust reaches the upwind turbine at approximately t = 450 s, triggering an emergency overspeed shutdown at t = 466.7 s. The Extreme Coherent gust reaches the downwind turbine at approximately t = 520 s, triggering an emergency overspeed shutdown at t = 538.6 s. By t = 541.2 s both turbines have been shut down.

\begin{figure}[htbp] \label{fig6-28}

Figure \ref{fig6-29} shows power generation. We see that early in the simulation the upwind turbine is generating a very constant and consistent 5,000 kW of power while The downwind turbine is generating less power and has some fluctuations in power generation. At t = 450 s we see how the Extreme operating gust and the subsequent emergency overspeed shutdown affect power generation of the upwind turbine. The turbine has a small increase then a sharp drop in power production. After t = 469.2 s the upwind turbine is not producing power. At t = 520 s we see how the Extreme operating gust and the subsequent emergency overspeed shutdown affect power generation of the downwind turbine. The downwind turbine experiences a large increase in power generation as it is briefly put into region 3 operation, but is soon experiences an emergency overspeed shutdown and a sharp drop in power production. After t = 541.2 s the downwind turbine is not producing power.

\begin{figure}[htbp] \label{fig6-29}

On average the downwind turbine is producing approximately 2800 kW of power prior to the arrival of the Extreme Coherent Gust. This is 44\% less power than the upwind turbine, which illustrates that wake effects can have a very large impact on power production.The downwind power generation seen in Figure \ref{fig6-27} is consistent with the rotor speeds seen in Figure \ref{fig6-28}, is consistent with results in Chapter \ref{chapter4}, and is consistent with results that other researchers have published for wake effects 20R downstream of a turbine in turbulence free conditions. For an NREL 5MW turbine, power production of 2800 kW corresponds to an effective incoming wind speed of 9.4 m/s. This indicates that the upwind turbine wake is causing an average wind velocity deficit of 22\%  at the downwind turbine (20R downstream), which is similar to what we see in Figure \ref{fig5-??velocity deficitfigure??}. A 22\% wind velocity deficit is consistent with the findings of Troldborg et al. for RANS (Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes) simulations of an NREL 5MW turbine \cite{troldborg2015}, and LES (Large Eddy Simulation) based simulations of a 2MW NEG Micon NM80 turbine \cite{troldborg2010,troldborg2010b}. A 22\% wind velocity deficit is also consistent with the dynamic wake meandering model described by Madsen et al. \cite{madsen2010}. These publications looked at a variety of turbine operating conditions and several noteworthy trends were found. Velocity deficit decreases as downstream distance increases. Velocity deficits decrease faster in turbulent conditions than in turbulence free conditions. Velocity deficits are largest when the turbine is in region 2 operation. When in region 3 operation, velocity deficit decreases as wind speed increases.


Figure \ref{fig6-30} shows the blade pitch of the turbines. Initially, the upwind turbine has a blade pitch of 4.8\degree and the downwind turbine has a pitch of 0\degree. As the upwind turbine begins to experience increased wind speed (at t = ~450 s) it's blade pitch increases in an effort to maintain a constant rotational speed of 12.1 RPM. The upwind turbine's blade pitch is at 15.3\degree when the emergency shutdown procedure is initiated at t = 466.7 s. After the emergency shutdown is initiated blade pitch increases to 90\degree at a rate of 8\degree /s. As the downwind turbine begins to experience increased wind speed (at t = ~520 s) the turbine maintains a blade pitch of 0\degree until the rotor speed increases to 12.1 RPM. Once the rotor speed reaches 12.1 RPM the turbine transitions from region 2 control to region 3 control and increases blade pitch in an effort to maintain that rotational speed. The upwind turbine's blade pitch is at 10.4\degree when the emergency shutdown procedure is initiated at t = 538.6 s.

\begin{figure}[htbp] \label{fig6-30}

Figures \ref{fig6-31} shows blade root bending moment (BRM). The BRM loading behavior for the upwind turbine looks very similar to what we saw in the offset turbine test cases (figures \ref{fig6-18} and \ref{fig6-24}). Before the Extreme Coherent Gust arrives, BRM loading cycles are very consistent in both shape and magnitude. When the upwind turbine begin to experience higher wind speeds and blade pitch begins to increase, the BRM loading cycle maintains it's shape but begins to decrease in magnitude. Durring the emergency shutdown process the shape of the BRM loading cycle changes and the magnitude of the BRM loading cycle increases. When the rotor comes to a halt the BRM settles to a constant value. The BRM loading behavior of the downwind turbine has a few key differences. Early in the simulation, because of wake effects, BRM loading cycles for the downwind turbine are less consistent in shape and BRM has a slightly lower magnitude on average. When the Extreme Coherent gust arrives at the downwind turbine at approximately t = 520 s, BRM loads increase instead of decreasing. This brief period of high loading is because the turbine maintains a 0\degree blade pitch angle until the rotor speed increases to 12.1 RPM. The combination of high wind speed and low blade pitch angle causes very high aerodynamic loading on the turbine blade. Durring the emergency shutdown process the shape of the BRM loading cycle changes and the magnitude of the BRM loading cycle increases. Because the downwind turbine has a higher BRM when emergency shutdown is initiated, the downwind turbine experiences larger loads during the shutdown. Eventually the upwind and downwind turbines settle to different BRM values. This is simply because the turbines are at different points in their rotation when they come to a halt.

\begin{figure}[htbp] \label{fig6-31}

In Figure \ref{fig6-32} we see that the tower base fore-aft bending moments for the upwind turbine is initially constant at approximately 48 MNm. The tower base bending moment is highly dependent on the aerodynamic loading, which is highly dependent on blade pitch. As wind speeds begin to increase and blade pitches begin to increase we see a smooth reduction in tower fore-aft bending moment. The emergency shutdown process introduces a lot more oscillation in the tower base fore-aft bending moment, including one very large loading cycle where loading goes from approximately 47 MNm to approximately -41 MNm. Early in the simulation the downwind turbine has slightly lower tower base fore-aft bending moments, but has more fluctuations in loading. This is due to wake effects. When the Extreme Coherent gust arrives at the downwind turbine we see a sharp increase in loading instead of the decrease in loading the upwind turbine exhibited. As discussed in the previous paragraph, this is because the downwind turbine maintains a 0\degree blade pitch angle until the rotor speed increases to 12.1 RPM. The combination of high wind speed and low blade pitch angle causes very high aerodynamic loading. The emergency shutdown process introduces a lot more oscillation in the tower base fore-aft bending moment, including one very large loading cycle where loading goes from approximately 76 MNm to approximately -46 MNm.

\begin{figure}[htbp] \label{fig6-32}

Table \ref{table6-5} summarizes several important performance metrics for the turbines. We see that the downwind turbine has much higher Damage Equivalent Loads (DEL) than the upwind turbine. If we look at figures \ref{fig6-31} and \ref{fig6-32} it is easy to see where the discrepancy in DEL is coming from. The downwind turbine has much higher loads and more loading fluctuations between the arrival of the extreme coherent gust and when the turbines come to a halt. However, I think it's useful to discuss what this means for the turbines and what the root cause of this discrepancy is. This discrepancy means that an extreme coherent gust is more damaging to a turbine in a wake than to a turbine that is not in a wake. There are two ways to think of the root cause. First, you can focus on the brief period of time where the downwind turbine is in high winds but has low blade pitch. You can note that this combination causes very high aerodynamic loading, which causes large and potentially damaging structural loads. Second, you can focus on the wind speed variation each turbine is experiencing due to the Extreme Coherent Gust. The upwind turbine is initially operating in 12 m/s wind then experiences a suden increase of 13 m/s to a 25 m/s wind speed. The downwind turbine is initially operating in an average wind speed of 9.4 m/s then experiences a suden increase of 15.6 m/s to a 25 m/s wind speed. Part of that increase in wind speed due to the Extreme Coherent Gust increasing wind speed from 12 m/s to 25 m/s. The other part of the increase is because the upwind turbine has shut down and is no longer blocking some of the wind.  


Table \ref{table6-5} also shows that both turbines experience similar maximum rotor overspeeds. Finally, we see that the upnwind turbine produces 38.88 KWh more energy than the downwind turbine. The downwind turbine operates for a longer period of time before it experiences an emergency overspeed shutdown. However, as we see in Figure \ref{fig6-29}, the downwind turbine is generating less power than the upwind turbine due to wake effects.

 6.7.3 Performance With Feed Forward Derating Control *********************

Figure \ref{fig6-32} shows wind speed in the computational domain at several key moments when feed forward derating control is enabled. The first few images in Figure \ref{fig6-32} look very similar to the results presented in Section \ref{section6-7-2} (Figure \ref{fif6-27}). However, at t = 600 s we see a noteworthy difference between these simulation results and the results discussed in Subsection \ref{section6-7-2}. We see a wake trailing the downwind turbine. This indicates that it has not shut down in response to the extreme coherent gust.

\begin{figure}[htbp] \label{fig6-33}

Figures \ref{fig6-34} through \ref{fig6-38} show the rotor speed, power generation, blade pitch, blade root bending moment, and tower base fore-aft bending moment of the turbines.  The Extreme Coherent Gust reaches the upwind turbine at approximately 450 s, causing both the rotor speed (Figure \ref{fig6-34}) and power generation (Figure \ref{fig6-35}) to increase. At t = 469.7 s the rotor speed exceeds the 15\% overspeed limit and an emergency overspeed shutdown is initiated. At this point the feed forward derating control scheme described in Section \ref{section4-5} is initiated. A signal is sent to the downwind turbine instructing it to derate by 11.12\% beginning at t = 478.7 s and return to full rated operation at t = 624.2 s. Between t = 478.7 s and t = 508.7 s the downwind turbine smoothly reduces it's rotor speed and power generation. When the Extreme Coherent Gust arrives at approximately t = 520 s it does induce a spike in rotor speed, but the maximum overspeed is 11.7\% and it does not cause an emergency overspeed shutdown. Between t = 624.2 s and t = 654.2 s the downwind turbine transitions back to full rated operation.

\begin{figure}[htbp] \label{fig6-34}
\begin{figure}[htbp] \label{fig6-35}

Figure \ref{fig6-36} shows the blade pitch of the turbines. As we saw in Section \ref{section6-7.2}, the upwind turbine starts with a blade pitch of 4.8\degree, but the Extreme Coherent Gust and the subsequent emergency overspeed shutdown cause blade pitch to increase to 90\degree. Initially the downwind turbine has a blade pitch of 0\degree, but  blade pitch is increases to 2.6\degree when the turbine is derated (starting at t = 481.7 s). The Extreme Coherent Gust causes an increase and some oscillation in downwind turbine blade pitch, with the blade pitch eventually settling to approximately 25.5\degree. The downwind turbine is the returned to full rated operation starting at t = 624.2 s, which decreases the blade pitch to 23.1\degree.

\begin{figure}[htbp] \label{fig6-36}



Figures \ref{fig6-37} shows blade root bending moment (BRM). As we saw in the previous subsection, the BRM loading for the upwind turbine is cyclical and very consistent until the Extreme Coherent Gust arrives. The gust and the ensuing emergency shutdown cause a short period where the loading cycles have larger magnitudes and more irregular shapes. Early in the simulation, because of wake effects, BRM loading cycles for the downwind turbine are less consistent in shape and BRM has a slightly lower magnitude on average. BRM loads decrease when the downwind turbine is derated at t = 478.7 s. There is a brief increase in BRM loads when the Extreme Coherent Gust reaches the turbine at approximately t = 520 s. This period of high loading occurs while the downwind turbine is transitioning from region 2 derated control to region 3 derated control. By t = 550 s the mean BRM decreases to approximately 3 MNm (~60\% below the initial mean BRM) and the cyclical fluctuations in BRM have increased to approximately 4 MNm (~140\% above the initial magnitude of fluctuations).


\begin{figure}[htbp] \label{fig6-37}


As in previous simulations, the upwind turbine has a tower base fore-aft bending moment of approximately 48 MNm before the Extreme Coherent Gust arrives. The upwind turbine experiences a short period of cyclical loading, including one cycle with a very large magnitude, in response to the Extreme Coherent Gust and the ensuing emergency shutdown. Early in the simulation the downwind turbine has slightly lower tower base fore-aft bending moments, but has more fluctuations in loading. When the turbine is derated starting at t = 478.7 s tower base fore-aft bending moments are decreased further. This is consistent with a reduction in aerodynamic loading on the turbine rotor due to increasing blade pitch. When the Extreme Coherent gust arrives at the downwind turbine we see a sharp increase in loading to 63.4 MNm. As discussed in the previous paragraph, this brief period of high loading occurs as the turbine transitions from region 2 to region 3 control. By t = 550 s the mean tower fore-aft bending moment has decreased to approximately 2 MNm. However, we see the introduction of a cyclic loading component that persists through the end of the simulation. If we zoom in on these high frequency oscillations we see that the loading has a very similar shape to the cyclic BRM loading seen in Figure \ref{fig6-37}, but has a frequency three times higher. Since the turbine rotor has three blades, this indicates that the higher magnitude BRM oscillations seen near the end of the simulation are causing the high frequency oscillations in tower loading. 


\begin{figure}[htbp] \label{fig6-38}

Table \ref{Table6-6} summarizes several important performance metrics for the turbines. As expected, the upwind turbine performance is identical to what was observed in the previous subsection. However, the downwind performance has changed. We see that the downwind turbine significantly out performs the upwind turbine in tower base fore-aft bending moment DEL, maximum overspeed, and energy generation. The downwind turbine performs a little worse that the upwind turbine in blade root bending moment DEL.

\begin{table} \label{Table6-6}


Table \ref{table6-7} illustrates the effect of feed forward derating control by comparing  performance of the downwind turbine in this simulation to the downwind turbine performance in Section \ref{section6-7-2}. As the table shows,  feed forward derating control improves turbine behaviour in all four of the performance metrics.


 Tower base fore-aft bending moment DEL has been reduced by 58.1 MNm, which is a reduction of 56\%. This is likely because the downwind turbine with feed forward derating control does not experience the very large magnitude loading cycles observed immediately prior to and durring emergency shutdown. Blade root bending moment DEL has been reduced by 15% despite the turbine operating for a longer period of time. In Section \ref{section6-7-2}, when feed forward derating control was not enabled, the downwind turbine shut down and stopped accruing DEL at t = 541.2 s. Maximum overspeed has been reduced to 11.7\%, which will not induce an emergency shutdown. Energy generation has been increased by 201.14 KWh.

\begin{table} \label{Table6-4}

 It is important to note that the difference in energy generation could be much larger in real world operation. These simulations end at t = 700 s, but beyond that time the downwind turbine with feed forward derating control would continue to generate 5 MW (or ~1.4 KWH per second). The downwind turbine without feed forward derating control would not generate any power until it was returned to service. That turbine may be shut down for much longer than the 158.8 seconds captured in these simulations.
