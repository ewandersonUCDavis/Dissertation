The turbine in wake test case simulates a two turbine system where one turbine is 1260 m (or 20R, where R is the rotor radius) directly behind another turbine. This configuration is illustrated as "Configuration #1" in Figure \ref{fig6-1}. The simulation domain is 5040 m \times 2520 m \times \2520 m (or 80R \times 40R \times 40R). This domain extends 1260 m upstream of the upwind rotor and 2520 m downstream of the downwind rotor, as well as 1260 m both horizontally and vertically from the centers of the rotors. The computational domain is initially composed of 32 m \times 32 m \times 32 m cells, but portions of the domain go through a series of grid refinements to reduce the size of the cells near the turbine rotors. The refinement regions are a series of 4 concentric cylinders with centerlines laying on the rotational axis of the NREL 5-MW rotors and having the dimensions shown in Table \ref{table6-1}. These refinement regions have the same radial dimensions as refinement regions 1 through 4 used in Chapter \ref{chapter5} SOWFA simulations (Table \ref{table5-1}). However, the streamwise dimensions have been increased to accomodate a second turbine.
