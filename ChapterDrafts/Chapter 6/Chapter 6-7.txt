In previous chapters we assumed the downwind turbine would be slightly offset from the upwind turbine and would not be in that turbine's wake. This was done out of necessity because FAST is not capable of modelling turbine wake effects. However, SOWFA is well suited to model turbine wakes and how those wakes effect downwind turbines. Mathew Churchfield and others at NREL have published several articles that use SOWFA to study such effects \ref{some sowfa studies}. Furthermore, wake effects are common in real world wind farms. This section documents SOWFA simulations of the turbine in wake test case illustrated in figure \ref{fig6-1}. In this test case one turbine is 1260 m (or 20R, where R is the rotor radius) directly behind and in the wake of another turbine.

6.6.1 Simulation Setup

The simulation domain is 5040 m \times 2520 m \times \2520 m (or 80R \times 40R \times 40R). This domain extends 1260 m (20R) in front of the upwind rotor and 2520 m (40R) behind the downwind rotor, as well as 1260 m (20R) both horizontally and vertically from the centers of the rotors. The computational domain is initially composed of approximately 32 m \times 32 m \times 32 m cells, but portions of the domain go through a series of grid refinements to reduce the size of the cells near the turbine rotors. The refinement regions are a series of 4 concentric cylinders with centerlines laying on the rotational axis of the NREL 5-MW rotors and having the dimensions shown in Table \ref{table6-1}. These refinement regions have the same radial dimensions as refinement regions 1 through 4 used in Chapter \ref{chapter5} SOWFA simulations (Table \ref{table5-1}). However, the streamwise dimensions have been increased to accomodate a second turbine. In the streamwise direction refinement regions 1, 2, 3, and 4 begin 8.5R, 4.5R, 2.5R, and 1.5R (respectively) in front of the upwind turbine.

Table6-5 *********************************

Each simulation is 700 seconds long, but the first 300 seconds are disregarded. This is to ensure that both turbines and their wakes have reached steady state before we start collecting data. Initially the inlet of the computational domain has a uniform 12 m/s wind speed. At 400 seconds a coherent gust is introduced in the center of the computational domain inlet. 

The coherent gust used for the turbine in wake test case is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig6-26} and is described by equation \ref{eq6-4}, where r_g is the radial distance from the centerline of the turbine rotors. As discussed in Section \ref{section6-5}, the coherent gust contains both higher speed regions (up to 26.41 m/s) and lower speed regions (as low as 7.59 m/s) so the average wind speed across the computational domain inlet remains 12 m/s. For the regions directly upwind of the turbine rotors the average wind speed durring the extreme operating gust is 25 m/s, which is the upper limit of the NREL 5MW turbine operating range.

6.7.2 Performance Without Feed Forward Derating Control *********************

Figure \ref{fig6-27} shows wind speed in the computational domain at several key moments. Each image in Figure \ref{fig6-14} was generated by taking a horizontal cross section through the center of the computational domain then trimming the cross section to remove regions that were far from the turbines in the downwind or horizontal directions. White lines have been superimposed on the images to show the locations and approximate sizes of the turbine rotors. At t=300 s we see that the upwind turbine is operating in a steady, uniform 12 m/s wind. The downwind turbine is subject to a lower and less consistent wind speed because it is in the wake of the upwind turbine. At t = 400 s the Extreme Coherent Gust enters the computational domain. We see at t = 420 s that the gust has begun to propagate through the domain from left to right. At t = 480 s we see that the gust has recently reached the upwind turbine. At t = 540 s we see the gust arriving at the downwind turbine. In the t = 540 s image we can also see that there is no wake trailing the upwind turbine. This indicates that the upwind turbine has shut down. At t = 660 s we see that the gust has continued to propagate downstream and there is no wake trailing the downwind turbine, which indicates that it has also shut down.
