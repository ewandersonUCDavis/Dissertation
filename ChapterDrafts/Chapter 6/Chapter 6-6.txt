6.6 Offset Turbine Test Case

This section documents SOWFA simulations of the offset turbine test case illustrated in figure \ref{fig6-1}. In this test case one turbine is 20R downwind of and 3R to the side of another turbine, where R is the rotor radius of 63 meters. Because of the 3R offset, the downwind turbine is not in the wake of the upwind turbine. This is the configuration that was assumed for FAST simulations of feed forward derating control carried out in Chapter \ref{chapter4}.  

6.6.1 Simulation Setup

The computational domain is 80R (5,040 m) long, extending 20R in front of the upwind turbine and 40R behind the downwind turbine. The domain is 40R tall, extending 20R above and below the turbine rotors. The domain is also 40R. Each rotor is 38.5R from one side and 41.5R from the other side due to the offset between the upwind and downwind turbine. Initially the domain is constructed of cube shaped cells approximately 32 m \times 32 m \times 32 m, but portions of the domain go through a series of grid refinements to reduce the size of cells to approximately 2 m \times 2 m \times 2 m near the rotors. Table \ref{table6-1} describes the dimensions and resolutions of each refinement region. The first three refinement regions are rectangular cuboid shaped regions that encompass both turbines. These refinement regions are centered in the computational domain with respect to width and height. In the streamwise direction refinement regions 1, 2, and 3 begin 8.5R, 4.5R, and 2.5R (respectively) in front of the upwind turbine. Refinement regions 4 and 5 are cylindrical in shape and each encompass one of the two turbines. Each of these cylindrical refinement regions is centered on the rotational axis of a turbine rotor, extending 1.5R in front of and 12R behind the rotor.

\begin{table} \label{Table6-1}

Each simulation is 700 seconds long, but the first 300 seconds are disregarded. This is to ensure that both turbines and their wakes have reached steady state before we start collecting data. Initially the inlet of the computational domain has a uniform 12 m/s wind speed. At 400 seconds a coherent gust is introduced in the center of the computational domain inlet. 

The coherent gust used in the offset turbine test case is 567 m tall \times 756 m wide and is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig6-13}. This is essentially a round gust that has been elongated by 3R (189 m) to ensure it encompasses both turbines. For the part of the gust between the rotor centerlines,  wind speed is given by equation \ref{eq6-2}, where h_g is the distance above or below the rotor centerlines. For the part of the gust to the left or right of the rotor center lines, wind speed is given by equation \ref{eq6-3}, where r_g is the radial distance from the closest rotor centerline. As discussed in Section \ref{section6-5}, the coherent gust contains both higher speed regions (up to 26.16 m/s) and lower speed regions (as low as 5.11 m/s) so the average wind speed across the computational domain inlet remains 12 m/s. For the regions directly upwind of each rotor the average wind speed durring the extreme operating gust is 25 m/s, which is the upper limit of the NREL 5MW turbine operating range.

6.6.2 Performance Without Feed Forward Derating Control *********************

Figure \ref{fig6-14} shows wind speed in the computational domain at several key moments. Each image in Figure \ref{fig6-14} was generated by taking a horizontal cross section through the center of the computational domain then trimming the cross section to remove regions that were far from the turbines in the downwind or horizontal directions. White lines have been superimposed on the images to show the locations and approximate sizes of the turbine rotors. At t=300 s we see the turbines operating in a steady, uniform 12 m/s wind. The wakes of each turbine are clearly visible, and we see that the downwind turbine is not in the wake of the upwind turbine. At t = 400 s the Extreme Coherent Gust enters the computational domain. We see at t = 420 s that the gust has begun to propagate through the domain from left to right. Note that the gust has higer wind speeds at it's center and lower wind speeds near it's edges (as discussed in Section \ref{section6-4}). At t = 480 s we see that the gust has recently reached the upwind turbine. At t = 540 s we see the gust arriving at the downwind turbine. In the t = 540 s image we can also see that there is no wake trailing the upwind turbine. This indicates that the upwind turbine has shut down.
 At t = 660 s we see that the gust has continued to propagate downstream and there is no wake trailing the downwind turbine, which indicates that it has also shut down.
 
 \begin{figure}[htbp] \label{fig6-14} 
 
It's noteworthy that the gust traveled from the upwind turbine to the downwind turbine in approximately 70 seconds. This corresponds to a convection speed of approximately 18 m/s. For many of the simulations carried out in chapters \ref{chapter3} and \ref{chapter4} I assumed Taylor's frozen turbulence hypothesis was valid. I made that assumption because it allowed me to model a two turbine system using FAST, but I noted at the time that the assumption was not expected to be completely valid. If Taylor's frozen turbulence hypothesis was valid for this test case we would expect the gust to propagate downstream at the average domain wind speed of 12 m/s. However, the gust propagates at neither the average wind speed (12 m/s) nor the gust wind speed (~25 m/s), but somewhere in between. This reinforces the importance of using a feed forward control scheme that is tolerant of uncertainty about gust propagation speeds. As discussed in Section \ref{section4-5}, the feed forward selective derating control scheme evaluated in this chapter is highly tolerant of uncertainty in gust propagation speed. The fed forward controller is not required to take any action at the exact moment the gust reaches the downwind turbine. It simply has to derate the turbine some time before the gust arrives and return the turbine to full rated operation some time after the gust has passed.

Figures \ref{fig6-15} through \ref{fig6-19} show the rotor speed, power generation, blade pitch, blade root bending moment, and tower base fore-aft bending moment of the turbines. We see in figures \ref{fig6-15} and \ref{fig6-16} that both turbines have reached steady state operation by t = 300 s. The rotors are turning at a constant rate of 12.1 RPM and both turbines are producing 5 MW. The Extreme Coherent gust reaches the upwind turbine at approximately 450 s, causing both the rotor speed and power generation to increase. At t = 469.7 s the rotor speed exceeds the 15\% overspeed limit and an emergency overspeed shutdown is initiated. The upwind rotor comes to a halt at t = 480.9 s and is stationary for the remaining 219.1 seconds of the simulation. In real world operation this turbine would remain stationary until an operator can verify that is safe to return the turbine to operation. This could potentially be much longer than 219.1 seconds. The Extreme Coherent gust reaches the downwind turbine at approximately 520 s, causing both the rotor speed and power generation to increase. At t = 539.2 s the down wind rotor speed exceeds the 15\% overspeed limit and an emergency overspeed shutdown is initiated. By t = 550.5 seconds both turbines have been shut down and no power is being generated.

\begin{figure}[htbp] \label{fig6-15} 
\begin{figure}[htbp] \label{fig6-16} 

Figure \ref{fig6-17} shows the blade pitch of the turbines. Initially, when the turbines are operating in uniform 12 m/s wind both turbines have a steady blade pitch of 4.8\degree. As each turbine begins to experience increased wind speed it's blade pitch increases. This is an effort by the turbine pitch controller to maintain a constant rotational speed of 12.1 RPM. We see in Figure \ref{fig6-17} the upwind turbine has a blade pitch of 18.3\degree when the emergency shutdown procedure is initiated at t = 469.7 s. After the emergency shutdown is initiated blade pitch increases to 90\degree at a rate of 8\degree /s. The downwind turbine shows similar behavior, reaching a blade pitch of 20.3\degree before the emergency shutdown is initiated at t = 539.2 s.

\begin{figure}[htbp] \label{fig6-17}

Figures \ref{fig6-18} shows blade root bending moment (BRM). Initially, when the turbines are operating in uniform 12 m/s wind the blade root bending moment is very regular and both turbines experience nearly identical cyclical loading. When the turbines begin to experience higher wind speeds and blade pitch begins to increase, the BRM loading cycle maintains it's shape but begins to decrease in magnitude. This effect is easiest to see in the downwind turbine BRM between t = 500 s and t = 535 s, but it is also present in the upwind turbine BRM from t = 430 s to t = 465 s. Durring the emergency shutdown process the shape of the BRM loading cycle changes and the magnitude of the BRM loading cycle increases. When the rotor comes to a halt the BRM settles to a constant value. Note that BRM is not 0 MNm when the turbine rotor stops. This residual loading is due to gravitational loads. BRM would only be 0 MNm if this blade happened to stop pointing directly up or down.

\begin{figure}[htbp] \label{fig6-18}

In Figure \ref{fig6-19} we see that the tower base fore-aft bending moments is initially constant at approximately 48 MNm. The tower base bending moment is highly dependent on the aerodynamic loading, which is highly dependent on blade pitch. As wind speeds begin to increase and blade pitches begin to increase we see a smooth reduction in tower fore-aft bending moment. The emergency shutdown process introduces a lot more oscillation in the tower base fore-aft bending moment, including one very large loading cycle where loading goes from approximately 35 MNm to approximately -40 MNm. This large spike in negative loading moment corresponds to the tower swinging forward after the aerodynamic loading on the rotor is suddenly reduced to zero when the blades pitch to 90\degree. Eventually all of the high frequency oscillations in loading die out and the tower base fore-aft bending moement settles to 0 MNm.

Table \ref{table6-2} summarizes several important performance metrics for the turbines. We see that both turbines have very similar tower base fore-aft bending moment Damage Equivalent Loads (DEL). This was expected based on Figure \ref{fig6-19}. Cyclic loading is the primary driver of DEL values (as discussed in Appendix \ref{AppendixC}) and both turbines experience similar tower base fore-aft bending moment cycles. We see that the downwind turbine experiences approximately 20\% higher blade root bending moment DEL. Part of this difference is because the cyclic loading a turbine blade experiences during normal operation and the fact that the downwind turbine operates for longer before it experiences an emergency shutdown. A contributing factor may also be the differences in the loading patterns observed near shutdown in Figure \ref{fig6-18}. These differences in loading patterns are caused by the interaction of the loading induced by the extremem coherent gust and the cyclic loading due to the rotation of the turbine rotor. Both turbines experience similar maximum rotor overspeeds. The slight differences observed are likely due to small changes in the shape of the extreme coherent gust as is propagates downstream. Finally, we see that the downwind turbine produces 96.46 KWh more energy than the upwind turbine. This is simply because the extremem coherent gust arrives at the downwind turbine ~70 seconds after it arrives at the upwind turbine. This allows the downwind turbine to generate electricity for an additional 70 seconds before experiencing an emergency overspeed shutdown.

 6.6.3 Performance Without Feed Forward Derating Control *********************
  
Figure \ref{fig6-20} shows wind speed in the computational domain at several key moments when feed forward derating control is enabled. The first few images in Figure \ref{fig6-20} look very similar to Figure \ref{fif6-14}. We see both turbines in a steady 12 m/s wind then we see the extreme coherent gust propagating through the computational domain and arriving at the upwind turbine. At t = 540 s we see the gust arriving at the downwind turbine and we see that the upwind turbine is no longer producing a wake, which indicates it has stopped operating. At t = 600 s we see a noteworthy difference between these simulation results and the results discussed in Subsection \ref{section6-6-2}. We see a wake trailing the downwind turbine. This indicates that it has not shut down in response to the extreme coherent gust.

\begin{figure}[htbp] \label{fig6-20}


Figures \ref{fig6-21} through \ref{fig6-25} show the rotor speed, power generation, blade pitch, blade root bending moment, and tower base fore-aft bending moment of the turbines. The Extreme Coherent Gust reaches the upwind turbine at approximately 450 s, causing both the rotor speed (Figure \ref{fig6-21}) and power generation (FIgure \ref{fig6-22}) to increase. At t = 469.7 s the rotor speed exceeds the 15\% overspeed limit and an emergency overspeed shutdown is initiated. At this point the feed forward derating control scheme described in Section \ref{section4-5} is initiated. A signal is sent to the downwind turbine instructing it to derate by 10.37\% beginning at t = 481.7 s and return to full rated operation at t = 627.2 s. Between t = 481.7 s and t = 511.7 s the downwind turbine smoothly reduces it's rotor speed and power generation. When the Extrem Coherent Gust arrives at approximately t = 520 s it does induce a spike in rotor speed, but the maximum overspeed is 6.9\% and it does not cause an emergency overspeed shutdown. Between t = 627.2 s and t = 657.2 s the downwind turbine transitions back to full rated operation.


\begin{figure}[htbp] \label{fig6-21}
\begin{figure}[htbp] \label{fig6-22}

Figure \ref{fig6-23} shows the blade pitch of the turbines. Initially, both turbines have a blade pitch of 4.8\degree. The Extremem Coherent Gust causes the blade pitch of the upwind turbine to increase to 90\degree. The initial increase in blade pitch is an attempt by the upwind turbine to maintain a rotor speed of 12.1 RPM. Once the emergency overspeed shutdown is initiated the upwind turbine's blade pitch increases to 90\degree at a rate of 8\degree/s to provide aerodynamic braking for the emergency shutdown. The blade pitch of the downwind turbine increases from 4.8\degree to 6.1\degree when the turbine is derated (starting at t = 481.7 s). The Extreme Coherent Gust causes an increase and some oscillation in downwind turbine blade pitch, with the blade pitch eventually settling to approximately 25.5\degree. The downwind turbine is the returned to full rated operation starting at t = 627.2 s, which decreases the blade pitch to 23.1\degree.

\begin{figure}[htbp] \label{fig6-23}

Figures \ref{fig6-24} shows blade root bending moment (BRM). As we saw in the previous subsection, the BRM loading for the upwind turbine is cyclical and very consistent until the Extreme Coherent Gust arrives. The gust and the ensuing emergency shutdown cause a short period where the loading cycles have larger magnitudes and more irregular shapes. BRM loading for the downwind turbine is also cyclical and the cycles are very consistent in shape and magnitude. When the downwind turbine is derated starting at t = 481.7 s, the mean BRM decreases by approximately 12\% and the magnitude of the cyclical fluctuations in BRM increase by aproximately 9\%. These changes are primarily due to the increase in blade pitch caused by derating. When the Extremem Coherent Gust arrives and blade pitch is increased further the mean BRM decreases to approximately 3 MNm (~60\% below the initial mean BRM) and the cyclical fluctuations in BRM have increased to approximately 4 MNm (~140\% above the initial magnitude of fluctuations).

\begin{figure}[htbp] \label{fig6-24}


In Figure \ref{fig6-25} we see that the tower base fore-aft bending moments is approximately 48 MNm with very little cyclical loading before the Extreme Coherent Gust arrives. The upwind turbine experiences a short period of cyclical loading, including one cycle with a very large magnitude, in response to the Extreme Coherent Gust and the ensuing emergency shutdown. The downwind turbine experiences a reduction in tower base fore-aft bending moment when the turbine is derated starting at t = 481.7 s. This is consistent with a reduction in aerodynamic loading on the turbine rotor due to increasing blade pitch. When the Extreme Coherent Gust arrives the downwind turbine sees a further reduction in the average tower base fore-aft bending moment. However, we see the introduction of a cyclic loading component that persists through the end of the simulation. If we zoom in on these high frequency oscillations we see that the loading has a very similar shape to the cyclic BRM loading seen in Figure \ref{fig6-23}, but has a frequency three times higher. Since the turbine rotor has three blades, this indicates that the higher magnitude BRM oscillations seen near the end of the simulation are causing the high frequency oscillations in tower loading. 

\begin{figure}[htbp] \label{fig6-25}

Table \ref{table6-3} summarizes several important performance metrics for the turbines. As expected, the upwind turbine performance is identical to what was observed in the previous subsection. However, the downwind performance has changed. We see that the downwind turbine significantly out performs the upwind turbine in tower base fore-aft bending moment DEL, maximum overspeed, and energy generation. The downwind turbine performs a little worse that the upwind turbine in blade root bending moment DEL.

\begin{table} \label{Table6-3}

We can isolate the effect of feed forward derating control and get more of an "apples to apples" comparison by comparing the performance of the downwind turbine in this simulation to the performance of the downwind turbine in the previous subsection. As Table \ref{Table6-4} shows, feed forward derating control improves turbine behaviour in all four of the performance metrics. Tower base fore-aft bending moment DEL has been reduced by 44.2 MNm, which is a reduction of 59\%. This is likely because the downwind turbine with feed forward derating control does not experience the very large magnitude loading cycles observed durring emergency shutdown. Blade root bending moment DEL has been reduced by 15% despite the turbine operating for a longer period of time. In the previous subsection, when feed forward derating control was not enabled, the downwind turbine shut down and stopped accruing DEL at t = 539.2 s. Maximum overspeed has been reduced to 6.9\%, which will not induce an emergency shutdown. Energy generation has been increased by 201.27 KWh.

\begin{table} \label{Table6-4}

 It is important to note that the difference in energy generation could be much larger in real world operation. These simulations end at t = 700 s, but beyond that time the downwind turbine with feed forward derating control would continue to generate 5 MW (or ~1.4 KWH per second). The downwind turbine without feed forward derating control would not generate any power until it was returned to service. That turbine may be shut down for much longer than the 149.5 seconds captured in these simulations.
