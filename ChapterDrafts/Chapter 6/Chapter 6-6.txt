6.6 Offset turbine test case

This section documents SOWFA simulations of the offset turbine test case illustrated in figure \ref{fig6-1}. In this test case one turbine is 20R downwind of and 3R to the side of another turbine, where R is the rotor radius of 63 meters. Because of the 3R offset, the downwind turbine is not in the wake of the upwind turbine. This is the configuration that was assumed for FAST simulations of feed forward derating control carried out in Chapter \ref{chapter4}.  

The computational domain is 80R (5,040 m) long, extending 20R in front of the upwind turbine and 40R behind the downwind turbine. The domain is 40R tall, extending 20R above and below the turbine rotors. The domain is also 40R. Each rotor is 38.5R from one side and 41.5R from the other side due to the offset between the upwind and downwind turbine. Initially the domain is constructed of cube shaped cells approximately 32 m \times 32 m \times 32 m, but portions of the domain go through a series of grid refinements to reduce the size of cells to approximately 2 m \times 2 m \times 2 m near the rotors. Table \ref{table6-1} describes the dimensions and resolutions of each refinement region. The first three refinement regions are rectangular cuboid shaped regions that encompass both turbines. Refinement regions 4 and 5 are cylindrical in shape and each encompass one of the two turbines.

Each simulation will be 700 seconds long, but the first 300 seconds will be disregarded. This is to ensure that both turbines and their wakes have reached steady state before we start collecting data. Initially the inlet of the computational domain has a uniform 12 m/s wind speed. At 400 seconds a coherent gust is introduced in the center of the computational domain inlet. 

The coherent gust used in the offset turbine test case is 567 m tall and 756 m wide. It is illustrated in figure \ref{fig6-6-1}. This is essentially a round gust that has been elongated by 3R (189 m) to ensure it encompasses both turbines. For the part of the gust between the rotor centerlines,  wind speed is given by equation \ref{eq6-2}, where h_g is the distance above or below the rotor centerlines. For the part of the gust to the left or right of the rotor center lines, wind speed is given by equation \ref{eq6-3}, where r_g is the radial distance from the closest rotor centerline. As discussed in Section \ref{section6-5}, the coherent gust contains both higher speed regions (up to 26.16 m/s) and lower speed regions (as low as 5.11 m/s) so the average wind speed across the computational domain inlet remains 12 m/s. For the regions directly upwind of each rotor the average wind speed durring the extreme operating gust is 25 m/s, which is the upper limit of the NREL 5MW turbine operating range.
